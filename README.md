# MAC MACKATHON 2025: LinkUp – Rewarding Engagement, Building Community

## Elevated Pitch
**By students, for students** — a space to foster real relationships, ideas, and growth.

## Overview
LinkUp is a digital platform designed to foster deeper student engagement by rewarding participation in both academic and co-curricular university events. The platform motivates students to get involved, make new connections, and enrich their university experience through a gamified reward system.

## Core Features

### 🎯 Reward System
Students earn points by attending events, workshops, seminars, club activities, and volunteering opportunities. These points can be redeemed for Monash-branded merchandise such as water bottles, t-shirts, tote bags, and exclusive event access.

### 📅 Event Hub
A centralized space where students can view upcoming academic and co-curricular events. Events are tagged by category (e.g., Academic, Social, Cultural, Career) and have clear instructions for participation and point rewards.

### 🧑‍🏫 Staff Portal
University staff and event organizers can create, edit, and manage events, including setting point values, attendance verification methods, and participant caps.

### 🧑‍💻 Student Integration
The platform integrates with Monash University's student database to authenticate users using their student ID and name, ensuring secure and personalized experiences.

### 🔗 Social Discovery
Optional interest-based group chats or discussion boards for each event allow students to connect with others attending the same event, encouraging conversation and collaboration.

## Why It Matters
Many students struggle to find meaningful ways to connect outside the classroom, but in person. LinkUp encourages participation not just through extrinsic motivation (rewards) but by opening the door to meet new people, explore interests, and feel more integrated into campus life.
